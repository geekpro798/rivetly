I will start the development server for the web application to allow for real-time preview and testing.

**Steps:**
1.  Navigate to the `rivetly-web` directory.
2.  Execute `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server.
3.  Provide you with the local preview URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
